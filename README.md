# Bool Network: A Bitcoin Verification Layer

## Introduction

Bool Network, a decentralized Bitcoin verification layer, addresses scalability and cross-chain challenges in Bitcoin's ecosystem. Leveraging advanced cryptography, Bool Network enhances scalability, security, and fosters cross-chain interoperability without altering Bitcoin's core consensus rules. This whitepaper presents a programmable framework for Bitcoin Layer 2 on Bool Network, emphasizing secure asset issuance and community-driven governance.
